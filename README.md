# Predicting-borrower-behaviour-using-Neural-Network
Predicting whether a loan borrower will pay back or not using Neural Networks.


How to run:
1) Recommended: Unzip my.zip as it contains featured engineered data. If you want to download the dataset from kaggle then you'd have to feature engineer yourself.
2) Download Anaconda Jupyter Notebook for Python.
3) Install libraries(Pandas, Numpy, SciKit Learn) with one liner commands.
4) Run the desired cells in Notebook using 'run' command.

Project Specs:
*  Language: Python
* Enviornment: Jupyter Notebook IDE
* Python Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, data_reader, plotly & Cufflinks
* Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club

Result: 90% accuracy predicting wether a user will default or pay back borrowed sums using conditions.
